## 🚀 Getting Started
Ready to use METAN? Follow these steps to get started:
1. Create a folder named 'C#' in your computer's C drive. (Required)
2. Clone this project.
4. Run file `BTTH02.exe` in path `C:\C#\Spotify\BTTH02\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows` and enjoy the app. ✔️
## ⚠️ Important Notice
- This app doesn't have any __login and registration functionality__ like my other projects.
- Since I use json files to manage data (which I really shouldn't do), the path needs to be exactly as I mentioned in the __🚀 Getting Started__ section above.
- When you want to add a song to __Playlist__, remember to enter exactly the name of playlist that you want to add.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- In this project, I use __C#__ and __Winform__ for development, I have created json files to store and manage data.
